# DEPRECATED 
Arknights_Penguin_Logistics_Operators_Face_Detection
Tensorflow Object Detection API

This project is continued from [this](https://github.com/lLoLii/Arknights_Mostima_Exusiai_Face_Detector).
That means this is still my first project.

The last one was with just 2 classes, but I upgraded the model to detect 4 more classes. (6 Operators from Arknights)

Also, Thanks to [this article]( https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/training-an-object-detection-model-with-tensorflow-api-using-google-colab-4f9a688d5e8b )
and [this repo]( https://github.com/EdjeElectronics/TensorFlow-Object-Detection-API-Tutorial-Train-Multiple-Objects-Windows-10) for helping me a lot.

And thank you for noticing this repo!

I am still a newbie to this subject so please forgive me for everything I have mistaken!
